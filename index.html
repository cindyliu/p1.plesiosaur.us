	        <h3>Bio</h3>

		<p>I am a candidate at Harvard Extension School for the ALM in Information Technology with a focus on Software Engineering. My undergraduate field was evolutionary biology (Harvard '09) and I have previously worked in biology research (primarily human genetics/genomics) as a lab tech. This website was created as a class project.
		</p>

		<p>I currently work at Harvard Business School as a staff assistant in the department of Research Computing Services, which provides research support to HBS faculty. In my spare time I am a classically trained soprano specializing in historical performance practice.
