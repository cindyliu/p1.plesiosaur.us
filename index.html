		<p>I'm an ALM candidate in IT-software engineering. This is a career change for me, as I'd previously planned to go to medical school before deciding that, much as I wanted to learn medicine, I had very little desire to be an actual physician. Due to my lack of prior background in the field, I'm essentially considering my ALM to be about equivalent to a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Harvard College.
		</p>

		<p>I graduated from Harvard in 2009 with a degree in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, which is an excellent field to be in as an undergrad - Harvard paid for me to go hiking and snorkeling in the tropics for 3 spring breaks. If I had continued along the field biologist route, I probably would have ended up a herpetologist chasing up rare frogs in the Caribbean, Central America, and Southeast Asia.
		</p>

		<p>Instead, I became a lab tech in a genetics lab at Harvard Medical School, where I stayed for 3 years. The job consisted of mostly various incarnations of PCR - some of which were very cool, don't get me wrong, but it was ultimately what convinced me that I didn't want to do biology anymore.
		</p>

		<p>I then went to music conservatory for a year - studying historical vocal performance at Longy, just up the street toward the Quad - and loved it, but dropped out because the other students and the general atmosphere were extremely unprofessional; and, to put it bluntly, I didn't want to deal with hysterical people anymore.
		</p>

		<p>After that I took a year to figure out my life, and ended up here, and couldn't be happier to be doing what I do - finally. My goal upon graduation is to get a job at a cool company as a software developer and spend the rest of my life building clever things cleverly. However, since I've not been long in the field, I'm exploring my options, and am so far very excited about this class.
		</p>

		<p class="note">Side note: I apologize for the length and tone of my "small bio"- I've sent out a million job applications recently and now anytime I'm asked to write about myself my brain goes into cover-letter mode....
